# broute - brutal router

```javascript
import {route, path, navigate} from 'broute'
```

#### route

`route(f)`

Declares the route function `f` which will be invoked each time the
url changes. There can only be one such function. The url is
"consumed" using nested scoped [`path`](#path) functions.

`:: (() ->) -> undefined`

arg | desc
:---|:----
f   | The one and only route function.
ret | Always `undefined`

##### route usage

The following usage shows how nested `path` declarations creates
"scoped" functions that consumes part of the current url.

```javascript
// the current url is: "/some/path/deep?panda=42"

route(() => {

    path('/some', (left, query) => {
        // at this point we "consumed" '/some'
        // and left is "/path/deep"
        // and query is {panda:42}
        path('/path/deep', (left, query) => {
          // left is "" and query is {panda:42}
        })
    })
    // at this point we haven't consumed anything
    path('/another', () => {
        // will not be invoked for the current url
    })
})
```

##### route example

```javascript
isItem = (part, query) => part?.length > 1        // '' means list

route(() => {

    path('/news/', (slugId) => {                  // consume '/news/'
        action('selectarticle', slugid)           // fire action to fetch article
    }, () => {
        action('refreshnewslist')                 // else refresh news list
    })
    path('/aboutus', () => {                      // consume '/aboutus'
        action('showaboutus')
    })
})
```

#### path

`path(p,f,fe)`

As part of [`route`](#route) declares a function `f` that is invoked
if we "consume" url part `p` of the current (scoped) url.

arg | desc
:---|:----
p   | The string url part to match/consume.
f   | Function to invoke when url part matches.
fe  | Optional else function if url part doesn't match.

##### path example

See [route usage](#route-usage) and [route example](#route-example).

#### navigate

`navigate(l)`
`navigate(l, false)`

Navigates to the location `l` using [pushState][push] and checks to
see if the url changed in which case the [route function](#route) is
executed.

The function takes an optional second boolean argument that can be
used to supress the execution of the route function.

This function is lazy when used inside [route](#route), only the last
location will be used when the route function finishes.

`:: string -> undefined`
`:: string, boolean -> undefined`

arg | desc
:---|:----
l   | The (string) location to navigate to. Can be relative.
t   | Optional boolean set to false to supress route function triggering.
ret | always `undefined`

##### navigate example

```javascript
// if browser is at "http://my.host/some/where"

navigate('other')   // changes url to "http://my.host/some/other"
navigate('/news')   // changes url to "http://my.host/news"


navigate('/didnt', false) // changes url to "http://my.host/didnt"
                          // without running the route function
```
