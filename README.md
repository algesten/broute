# broute - brutal router

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/algesten/broute.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/algesten/broute)

```javascript
import {path, navigate} from 'broute'
```

## path

`path(f)`  
`path(p,f)`  
`path(p,f,fe)`

Tests the given part fragment `p` and if current path matches,
consumes the fragment and invokes function `f`. If not match, no
consume and invoke optional function `fe`.

* `p` - path fragment to match from current scope
* `f` - function to invoke if fragment matches
* `fe` - optional "else" function to invoke if fragment doesnt match
* return - the result of `f` or `fe`

## vararg paths to test

`path(p1,f1,p2,f2,...,pn,fn,fe)`

Any number of paths can be tested and the first one that matches is run.

### function args

The `f` or `fe` is invoked with `(left, query)`. The first is the path
that is left after the `p` fragment has been consumed (not for `fe`).

* `left` - the path that is left after consuming fragment `p`
* `search` - the search parameters as object `?a=b` becomes `{a:'b'}`

### root 

On the root level, we can use path without a string arg. This is the
starting point of the route function that is invoked for every url
change. There can only be one root level path installed for each router.

```
path(() => {

})
```

#### path usage

The following usage shows how nested `path` declarations creates
"scoped" functions that consumes part of the current url.

```javascript
// the current url is: "/some/path/deep?panda=42"

path(() => {

    path('/some', (left, query) => {
        // at this point we "consumed" '/some'
        // and left is "/path/deep"
        // and query is {panda:42}
        path('/path/deep', (left, query) => {
          // left is "" and query is {panda:42}
        })
    })
    // at this point we haven't consumed anything
    path('/another', () => {
        // will not be invoked for the current url
    })
})
```

#### path example 2

```javascript
path(() => {

    path('/news/', (slugId) => {                  // consume '/news/'
        action('selectarticle', slugid)           // fire action to fetch article
    }, () => {
        action('refreshnewslist')                 // else refresh news list
    })
    path('/aboutus', () => {                      // consume '/aboutus'
        action('showaboutus')
    })
})
```

## navigate

`navigate(l)`  

Navigates to the location `l` using [pushState][push] and checks to
see if the url changed in which case the [path function](#path) is
invoked. 

* `l` - location to set. example `/my/page?foo=42`

#### navigate example

```javascript
// if browser is at "http://my.host/some/where"

navigate('other')   // changes url to "http://my.host/some/other"
navigate('/news')   // changes url to "http://my.host/news"
```

### lazy

`navigate` is lazy when used inside a path. in this example, only `/a`
and `/c` would be run. Furthermore the invocation of `/c` only happens
at the end of the root path function.

```javascript
path(() => {
    navigate("/b")
    navigate("/c")
    if (someCondition()) {
        ... // more code
    }
    // conceptually navigate("/c") happens here
})  
navigate("/a")
```

## Creating routers

For advanced usages, new routers can be created around arbitrary
"window" objects.

Conceptually broute does this for the default `path` and `navigate`
functions around a current global `window` variable:

```javascript
import router from 'broute'         // router function

{path, navigate} = router(window)  // create a router around window
```

If the `window` argument has an `addEventListener` function, a
listener will be added for [`popstate`][popstate] events. This means
broute will run the path function also for the back button as well as
via `navigate`.

On each `popstate` or `navigate` invocation, the `window` argument
is inspected for a property `window.location` which is expected to
hold an object:

```
{
  pathname: "/current/path", 
  search:   "?my=query"
}
```

If this object changes on `navigate` or `popstate`, the path function
is run.

If the `window` doesn't have a `window.history.pushState` function, `navigate`
will fall back on manipulating `window.location` directly.
