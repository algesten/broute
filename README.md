# broute - brutal router

### Router and Paths

#### route

`route(f)`

Declares the route function `f` which will be invoked each time the
url changes. There can only be one such function. The url is
"consumed" and "executed" using nested scoped
[`path`](#path)/[`exec`](#exec) functions.

`:: (() ->) -> undefined`

arg | desc
:---|:----
f   | The one and only route function.
ret | Always `undefined`

##### route usage

The following usage shows how nested `path` declarations creates
"scoped" functions that consumes part of the current url.

```coffee
# the current url is: "/some/path/deep?panda=42"

route ->

    path '/some', ->
        # at this point we "consumed" '/some'
        exec (part, query) ->
            # part is '/path'
            # query is {panda:42}

        path '/deep', ->
            exec (part, query) ->
                # part is ''
                # query is {panda:42}

    # at this point we haven't consumed anything
    exec (part, query) ->
        # part is '/some/path'
        # query is {panda:42}

    path '/another', ->
        # will not be invoked for the current url

```

##### route example

This tries to illustrate a more realistic example, including
[layout](#layout), [region](#region) and [action](#action).

```coffee
isItem = (part, query) -> part?.length > 1     # '' means list

route ->

    appview.top navbar          # show navbar view in top region
    appview.main homeview       # show home view in main region

    path '/news/', ->           # consume '/news/'
        if exec isItem                            # test if this is a news item
            exec (slugid) ->                      # use exec to get slugid from scoped path
                action 'selectarticle', slugid    # fire action to fetch article
                appview.main articleview          # show articleview in main region
        else
            action 'refreshnewslist'
            appview.main newslistview             # show newslist view in main region

    path '/aboutus', ->                           # consume '/aboutus'
        appview.main aboutusview                  # show aboutus view in main region
```

#### path

`path(p,f)`

As part of [`route`](#route) declares a function `f` that is invoked
if we "consume" url part `p` of the current (scoped) url.

arg | desc
:---|:----
p   | The string url part to match/consume.
f   | Function to invoke when url part matches.
ret | Always `undefined`

##### path example

See [route usage](#route-usage) and [route example](#route-example).

#### exec

`exec(f)`

As part of [`route`](#route) executes `f` with arguments
`(part,query)` for the current path scope.

arg | desc
:---|:----
f   | Function to invoke with `(part,query)`
ret | The result of the executed function.

##### exec example

See [route usage](#route-usage) and [route example](#route-example).

#### navigate

`navigate(l)`
`navigate(l, false)`

Navigates to the location `l` using [pushState][push] and checks to
see if the url changed in which case the [route function](#route) is
executed.

The function takes an optional second boolean argument that can be
used to supress the execution of the route function.

This function is lazy when used inside [route](#route), only the last
location will be used when the route function finishes.

`:: string -> undefined`
`:: string, boolean -> undefined`

arg | desc
:---|:----
l   | The (string) location to navigate to. Can be relative.
t   | Optional boolean set to false to supress route function triggering.
ret | always `undefined`

##### navigate example

```coffee
# if browser is at "http://my.host/some/where"

navigate 'other'    # changes url to "http://my.host/some/other"
navigate '/news'    # changes url to "http://my.host/news"


navigate '/didnt', false  # changes url to "http://my.host/didnt"
                          # without running the route function
```
